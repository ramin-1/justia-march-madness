# Lessons Learned

## Patterns to preserve

- Keep the local database as the source of truth even when external syncing is available.
- Add manual override paths whenever external parsing could fail.
- Put stable agent instructions in `AGENTS.md` and keep long-form context in linked docs instead of bloating one file.

**Mistake**: Proposed and kept temporary cookie-based middleware protection during Milestone 1 planning.
**Pattern**: Added scope that belongs to a later milestone instead of honoring milestone boundaries strictly.
**Rule**: For milestone-scoped scaffold tasks, avoid temporary auth or behavior hacks unless they are explicitly requested or required for build health.
**Applied**: Removed `middleware.ts` gating and kept admin routes as clearly labeled placeholders until Milestone 2.
